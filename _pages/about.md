Hi! I'm Katharina, a PhD student in the [Computational Linguistics Group](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/groups/AK/) of the Department of Language Science and Technology at Saarland University. I am supervised by [Prof. Alexander Koller](https://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~koller/) and [Prof. Jörg Hoffmann](https://fai.cs.uni-saarland.de/hoffmann/).
 
I'm working in the [A7](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/projects/controlling-information-density-in-discourse-generation/) project of the Collaborative Reserach Center on Information Density and Linguistic Encoding ([SFB 1102](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/)) and I'm associated with the Research Training Group on [Neuroexplicit Models](https://www.neuroexplicit.org/). 

The main topic of my PhD is on exploring the capabilities and limitations of using LLMs for complex reasoning tasks, in particular on classical planning tasks. I'm particularly interested in integrating LLM-based methods with symbolic methods that obtain approaches that reliably solving planning tasks and generalize to tasks of different complexity. Currently, I'm exploring the potential of LLMs to generate programs that solve planning tasks and generalize within a domain. 

My research interests include 
* Large Language Model for Planning and Reasoning
* (Length) generalization in the context of LLMs and planning
* LLM-based code generation 
* Neurosymbolic NLP approaches
* Learning from and adaption through interactions
* Grounded natural language generation
* Meaning representations
