Hi! I'm Katharina, a PhD student in Computational Linguistics in the Department of Language Science and Technology at Saarland University. My supervisor is Prof. Alexander Koller.
 
I'm working in the [A7](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/projects/controlling-information-density-in-discourse-generation/) project of the Collaborative Reserach Center on Information Density and Linguistic Encoding ([SFB 1102](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/)) and I'm associated with the Research Training Group on [Neuroexplicit Models](https://www.neuroexplicit.org/). 

My research interests include
