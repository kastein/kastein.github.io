**Under construction**

Hi! I'm Katharina, a PhD student in Computational Linguistics in the Department of Language Science and Technology at Saarland University. My supervisor is Alexander Koller.

I'm working in the [A7](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/projects/controlling-information-density-in-discourse-generation/) project of the Collaborative Reserach Center on Information Density and Linguistic Encoding ([SFB 1102](https://sfb1102.uni-saarland.de/)).
